The Git A Job allows you to search for tech jobs and store the content from your searches in one easy to access location.
You can even have your search results emailed to your for easy safekeeping when outside of the web environment.

Users can sign up for a Git A Job account, no password or email verification required. Once signed up they can login to their
account at any time by entering their username into the login field.

Users create a general profile (including address and phone number) when signing up.

A job search can be run as soon as a user is logged in. Jobs can be searched by one, none, or more of any 
of the following terms:

  - Location of choice for the prospective job
  - Part-Time or Full-Time position
  - The type of job requirements (Java, Python, DevOps, etc.)

The results of your job search will be displayed in a listing. Any of the listed jobs can be clicked for more details.

Once clicked, job details will appear on the right side of the screen. These details include things such as the location
of the job, the name of the company looking for employees, the company's website, and further details on how to apply.

At the bottom of the job details display are two buttons: one for adding that job to a user's personal list for later perusal,
and another for emailing those job details to the user's email address. Clicking the latter button will result in an email
immediately being sent to the email address listed in the user's profile.

The user can click on the profile button to go their profile page. This page will list any and all jobs they've added to their
personal list, as well as their profile details. Jobs can be removed from their list by clicking on the job listing here
and clicking the Remove from List button at the bottom of the job detail page. Jobs can also be emailed from here at that
same location.
